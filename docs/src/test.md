# Orientation

- ## Vibes

So this week I need to basically finish the analysis which means shoring up all of the checks, potentially and probably running new scripts, but then because of the resource advantage associated with a refactor it makes sense to try to do that refactor first, which in principle should be very accessible

- ## Context of Action
- ## Imperative Notions
    1.  Communicate Updates
    2.  Finish Research
    3.  Communicate Results
    4.  Write a Paper
- ## Response Approach & Strategy

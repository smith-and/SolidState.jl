we flow like ice
get ready for the slice
we keep it nice

don't think twice

or like a valley you fall
shear upon these giants
crumble you like gravel

grow life in this melt as I recede
cause the fresh water is coming
and that is all that you need

don't get lost in your greed
or it will make you mean

just keep it bad
and don't shit on the floor
